Complete Neural Dashboard Enhancement Plan

Current Issues:
- Very limited data display (just basic charts)
- No real-time processing breakdown
- Missing emotional state details  
- No memory activation tracking
- No personality trait changes
- No decision pathway visibility
- Unreadable chart-only interface
