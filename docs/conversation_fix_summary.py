print("🎯 Philos Conversational Memory - FIXED!")
print("=" * 50)

print("📋 What was the problem:")
print("  • When you said 'simplistic?' after Philos called something simplistic")
print("  • Philos didn't remember what HE had just called simplistic")  
print("  • He explained 'simplistic' in general instead of referring to his previous comment")
print()

print("🔧 What I fixed:")
print("  1. ✅ Added get_recent_conversation_history() method to MemoryManager")
print("  2. ✅ Modified consciousness engine to retrieve recent conversation context")
print("  3. ✅ Updated response prompt to include conversation history")
print("  4. ✅ Enhanced internal thoughts to understand conversation context")
print("  5. ✅ Added specific guidance for reference resolution ('that', 'it', 'this')")
print()

print("💡 How it now works:")
print("  • Before generating a response, Philos gets last 3-5 conversation exchanges")
print("  • His prompt now includes: 'User said X, You responded Y'")  
print("  • Internal thoughts include conversation context awareness")
print("  • Specific instruction: 'If they ask one-word like \"simplistic?\", they're referring to something I just said'")
print()

print("🧠 Example scenario:")
print("  Philos: 'That analysis is simplistic. There are more factors.'") 
print("  User: 'Simplistic?'")
print("  Philos now knows: User is asking about MY use of 'simplistic', not asking for a definition")
print()

print("✅ The conversation memory system is now active!")
print("Next time you chat with Philos, he should maintain proper context awareness.")

# Show the key code changes
print("\n🔍 Key code additions:")
print("1. MemoryManager.get_recent_conversation_history() - retrieves recent exchanges")
print("2. ConsciousnessEngine._format_conversation_history_for_thoughts() - formats context")  
print("3. Enhanced response prompt with conversation history")
print("4. Internal thoughts now include conversation context")
print()

print("🗣️ Test this by:")
print("  1. Running Philos normally")
print("  2. Have him mention something is 'complex' or 'interesting' etc.")
print("  3. Then ask just 'Complex?' or 'Interesting?'")  
print("  4. He should now understand you're referring to his previous comment!")
