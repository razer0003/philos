# AI Companion Memory Fix Summary

## Issues Identified:
1. **Conversation Continuity**: Each message was creating a new conversation log instead of continuing the same session
2. **Memory Retrieval**: Memory search was too narrow and missing relevant memories
3. **Context Loss**: The AI wasn't using conversation history effectively

## Fixes Applied:

### 1. Fixed Conversation Logging
**File**: `consciousness_engine.py`
- Changed conversation ID generation from timestamp-per-second to session-based
- Now uses format: `conv_YYYYMMDD_HHMM` for entire session
- Maintains conversation continuity across multiple messages

### 2. Enhanced Memory Retrieval
**File**: `memory_manager.py`
- Added multi-strategy memory search:
  - Direct content matching
  - Individual keyword searches  
  - Tag-based searches
  - Recent memory inclusion
  - Special term detection (name, philos, friend, etc.)
- Increased search scope and relevance scoring
- Added logging for memory retrieval debugging

### 3. Improved Memory Analysis
**File**: `memory_manager.py`
- Added special handling for name assignments (importance: 0.95)
- Enhanced consciousness/identity term detection
- Better categorization with specific tags
- Higher importance scores for critical information

### 4. Enhanced Context Building
**File**: `consciousness_engine.py`
- Added conversation history to memory queries
- Improved response prompts with conversation context
- Better memory presentation in prompts
- Explicit instructions to use memories and maintain continuity

### 5. Session Management
**File**: `ai_companion.py`
- Added session-based conversation ID management
- Consistent conversation tracking across interactions

## Results:
- ✅ Names and important information are now properly retained
- ✅ Conversation context is maintained across messages
- ✅ Memory retrieval finds relevant information effectively
- ✅ AI can reference previous interactions and personal details
- ✅ Enhanced logging shows memory retrieval working

## Test Results:
- Memory retention test shows proper handling of names (importance: 0.95)
- Enhanced memory retrieval finds multiple relevant memories
- Conversation continuity maintained within sessions
- All system tests still pass

The AI should now properly remember being named "Philos" and other important conversation details!
