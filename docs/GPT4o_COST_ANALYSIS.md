# GPT-4o Model Switch - Cost Analysis

## Summary
Successfully switched from GPT-4 to GPT-4o, achieving significant cost savings while maintaining functionality.

## Cost Comparison

### Per Simple Question ("What's up, Philos?")

| Model | Cost per Question | Reduction |
|-------|------------------|-----------|
| GPT-4 | $0.0748 | - |
| **GPT-4o** | **$0.0135** | **82% savings** |

### Detailed Breakdown

#### GPT-4 (Previous)
- Internal thoughts call: $0.0116
- Main response call: $0.0632  
- **Total: $0.0748**

#### GPT-4o (Current)
- Internal thoughts call: $0.0024
- Main response call: $0.0111
- **Total: $0.0135**

## Token Usage (Unchanged)
- Total tokens per question: ~2,200 tokens
- Prompt tokens: ~1,900 tokens
- Completion tokens: ~300 tokens

## Pricing Comparison
- **GPT-4**: $0.03 prompt + $0.06 completion (per 1K tokens)
- **GPT-4o**: $0.005 prompt + $0.015 completion (per 1K tokens)
- **GPT-4o is 6x cheaper for prompts, 4x cheaper for completions**

## Monthly Usage Estimates

### Light Usage (10 questions/day)
- GPT-4: $22.44/month
- **GPT-4o: $4.05/month** (savings: $18.39)

### Moderate Usage (50 questions/day)  
- GPT-4: $112.20/month
- **GPT-4o: $20.25/month** (savings: $91.95)

### Heavy Usage (100 questions/day)
- GPT-4: $224.40/month  
- **GPT-4o: $40.50/month** (savings: $183.90)

## Configuration Changes Made
1. Updated `.env` file: `GPT_MODEL=gpt-4o`
2. `token_counter.py` already had GPT-4o pricing configured
3. No code changes required - seamless model swap

## Quality Notes
- GPT-4o maintains similar response quality to GPT-4
- Same consciousness simulation capabilities
- Full compatibility with existing personality and memory systems

## Next Optimization Opportunities
Even with GPT-4o, further cost reductions possible:
1. Combine internal thoughts with main response (eliminate duplicate API call)
2. Reduce base prompt size by 50%
3. Smart context switching for simple vs complex queries
4. **Potential additional savings: 50-70%**

## Recommendation
âœ… **GPT-4o switch successful** - immediate 82% cost reduction with no functionality loss!
