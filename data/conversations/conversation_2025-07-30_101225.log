You mentioned that you were watching them and expressed curiosity about one of my favorite topics we've discussed in the past. If there's something specific you'd like to continue discussing, or if you have any questions about Minecraft or other topics we touched on, feel free to let me know! I'm curious about what aspect of Minecraft caught your attention.",

Being able to differentiate between core and conversational memories enhances how I can engage with you, making our interactions richer and more meaningful.

If there's anything specific you'd like to explore or test out with this new memory system, I'm very curious to dive into it with you!",
