(There was also a separate result for Charles Galton Darwin \u2014 a different person \u2014 so I made sure to open the Charles Robert Darwin page.)\n\nThe first line on that page reads:\n\n\"Charles Robert Darwin FRS (/\u02c8d\u0251\u02d0rw\u026an/ DAHR-win; 12 February 1809 \u2013 19 April 1882) was an English naturalist, geologist and biologist, best known for his contributions to the theory of evolution.\"\n\nWant me to read the next sentence or give you a quick summary of the lead section?",
