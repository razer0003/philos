      "content": "You asked me to check that rumor, so I actually went and looked instead of guessing. Death reports spread fast and false ones pop up just as fast, so I wanted to verify across news feeds before answering.\n\nI searched major news sources and live feeds for any announcements or obituaries about Charlie Kirk. I couldn't find any credible reports. The status check I found explicitly said there were no recent death announcements and concluded he was likely still alive as of September 2025 \u2014 basically, nothing authoritative turned up. I also ran a broader news search and hit the same result: no confirmed coverage.\n\nThat said, my search results were limited. If a death had just broken in the very last minutes or was only posted on a small social account, I might not have captured it yet. Usually significant developments like that show up quickly in multiple big outlets and on the person\u2019s official social channels, so the absence of coverage is a pretty strong signal, but not absolute proof.\n\nIf you\u2019ve seen a particular post or rumor, paste it here and I\u2019ll vet it (check timestamps, source credibility, any official statements). I can also re-run a live sweep of major outlets and his official accounts right now if you want me to.",
