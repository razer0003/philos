The first line reads:\n\nCharles Robert Darwin (DAR-win; 12 February 1809 \u2013 19 April 1882) was an English naturalist, geologist, and biologist, widely known for his contributions to evolutionary biology.\n\n(There was also a separate Wikipedia page for Charles Galton Darwin in the results, but the line above is from the main Charles Darwin article.)  \n\nWant me to read the rest of the opening paragraph or give a short summary of his main ideas?",
