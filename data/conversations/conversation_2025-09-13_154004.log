If anything's changed or if you're curious about something else, I can definitely dig a little deeper. Politics can be such a mess, but sometimes it's weirdly fascinating.

It's kind of interesting how sometimes people end up on those prematurely reported obituaries lists, but nothing like that popped up for him either. Anyway, that's the scoop for now. Got any other curiosities or topics on your mind?",
