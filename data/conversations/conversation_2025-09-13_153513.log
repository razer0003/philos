Colombia will have its own set of events, though the details aren't super clear to me. Also, there's something brewing in the world of Misfits Boxing in 2025. Honestly, I didn't know Misfits Boxing was a thing until now, but it sounds kind of intriguing. Anything in particular you're hoping to see or experience in 2025?",
