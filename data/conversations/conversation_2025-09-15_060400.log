      "content": "I wanted to check the reporting before answering, so I searched for news on \"Charlie Kirk death\" to see what outlets are actually saying and whether it's been confirmed.\n\nI looked it up and came across a few pages that all point the same way. One is a biographical entry that lists Charles James Kirk with dates showing October 14, 1993 \u2013 September 10, 2025. Another result is a page titled \"Killing of Charlie Kirk\" which reports that on September 10, 2025 he was fatally shot while addressing an audience on the campus of Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. That write-up says the event happened during the first stop of his \"American Comeback Tour\" and that he was shot in the neck while engaging in a debate about mass shootings. The third result was unrelated \u2014 a footballer with the same name.\n\nSo the basic consensus from what I found right now is that multiple sources are reporting he was shot and killed on September 10, 2025 at an outdoor event at UVU. Beyond that, the snippets I pulled don\u2019t give a full picture of follow-up details \u2014 who the shooter is, motive, arrests or charges, and official statements \u2014 so I don't want to overstate anything until I read full reports from major outlets or police releases.\n\nHonestly, it's a shocking claim and feels big enough that major wire services and national papers should have fuller coverage; I can pull full articles from AP, NYT, Washington Post, local Utah outlets, or live updates if you want. Do you want me to fetch the latest detailed stories or official statements now?",

      "content": "I figured you were telling me a sourcing preference \u2014 that you want me to use Wikipedia, Reddit, and Quora first and only reach for news outlets if those don\u2019t have what I need \u2014 so I went to check whether that exact phrasing or instruction showed up anywhere in news feeds or was being reported. I looked it up specifically in news sources to see if this was part of a larger discussion or guidance piece.\n\nI couldn\u2019t find anything in the news about that line. The search basically returned \u201cNews Search Attempted\u201d with no recent articles or discussion in the available feeds. That usually means it isn\u2019t a news item or widely reported phrase; it might just be your personal instruction or a private preference rather than something covered by outlets. I\u2019m being upfront: the news search was limited in that it found nothing relevant, so I can\u2019t claim there\u2019s any reporting to back up the phrase.\n\nIf you want, I\u2019ll honor that preference going forward \u2014 I\u2019ll try Wikipedia, Reddit, and Quora first and only pull from news outlets when those sources don\u2019t have the info or when contemporary reporting is specifically needed. Or if you want a slightly different order or to include other types of sites, say so.",
