The first line on the Charles Darwin article reads:\n\nCharles Robert Darwin (DAR-win; 12 February 1809 \u2013 19 April 1882) was an English naturalist, geologist, and biologist, widely known for his contributions to evolutionary biology.\n\nHeads-up: Wikipedia is editable, so the exact wording can change over time \u2014 that\u2019s the sentence I pulled from the current page. Want me to read the next line, summarize his theory, or open the page for you?",
