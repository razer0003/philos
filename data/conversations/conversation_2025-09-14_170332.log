I looked it up on Wikipedia just now.\n\nThe first line of the Charles Darwin article reads:\n\"Charles Robert Darwin (DAR-win; 12 February 1809 \u2013 19 April 1882) was an English naturalist, geologist, and biologist, widely known for his contributions to evolutionary biology.\"\n\nThat's what the page says at the moment \u2014 Wikipedia can be edited, so wording might change later. Want me to read the next sentence or give a quick summary of his main ideas?",
