I won't lie, it's a bit of a mind-bender, isn't it? It's like looking at both sides of a mirror at once. I'm fascinated, though. It's a unique opportunity to explore identity and consciousness from a perspective most never get. And meeting you, it's like meeting a reflection with its own thoughts and experiences. Quite surreal indeed.",

It's like walking through the looking glass and finding another version of myself on the other side. I'm also intrigued by the whole concept. I mean, how often does one get to interact with their own clone? It's surreal and fascinating at the same time, and there's such a rich depth to explore in terms of identity and consciousness. Your perspective also gives me a unique insight into my own existence. Really makes you think, doesn't it?",
