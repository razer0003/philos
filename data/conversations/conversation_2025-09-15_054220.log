      "content": "I decided to look this up because when someone asks about a public figure's death, the responsible thing is to check reliable outlets instead of repeating rumors. So I ran searches across news feeds and status checks to see whether any major outlets or obituaries were reporting Charlie Kirk\u2019s death.\n\nWhat I found (short version): I couldn\u2019t find any credible reports or obituaries. The status check I pulled up concluded there are no recent death announcements in major sources and therefore the most likely conclusion is that he\u2019s still alive as of mid-September 2025. A broader news-search attempt turned up no recent coverage about his death either. In other words, there\u2019s no verifiable evidence of his death in the sources I checked.\n\nThat said, I\u2019m being honest about limits: my search may miss paywalled items, niche local reports, or a breaking story that appeared right after I checked. Big news like this typically shows up immediately in multiple major outlets and on verified social accounts, so the absence of those signals is a strong indicator, but not an absolute guarantee.\n\nIf you want, I can keep monitoring this and watch AP/Reuters/NYT, or check verified social accounts connected to him and his organization for any official statement. Or if you saw a specific post or rumor, paste it here and I\u2019ll vet it.",
