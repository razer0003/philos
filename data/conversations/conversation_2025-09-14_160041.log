      "content": "I thought this was worth checking because your observation \u2014 that gpt-5-mini costs significantly less than gpt-4o \u2014 sounded plausible but odd, and I wanted to confirm whether there was a clear official explanation or recent change that would explain the difference.\n\nSo I did a quick search. I didn\u2019t find a clear, authoritative article or changelog that directly explains that exact price gap \u2014 the search came up empty/limited (basically no definitive results). Bottom line: I couldn\u2019t find a single up-to-date source that says \u201chere\u2019s exactly why gpt-5-mini is cheaper than gpt-4o.\u201d\n\nThat said, there are a number of sensible, non-mystical reasons this could be happening:\n\n- Model size and compute cost: \u201cmini\u201d models are usually much smaller and cheaper to run per token than large, high-capacity models (gpt-4o is likely more costly to infer).\n- Performance/latency/throughput tradeoffs: cheaper models can be optimized for cost or speed at the expense of some capability.\n- Different billing units: one model might be priced per-token while another has per-request or per-minute characteristics, making certain usage patterns costlier.\n- Feature tiers and safety/guardrails: more advanced models may have additional safety/fine-tuning or specialized features that justify higher pricing.\n- Pricing strategy/market segmentation: newer models or experimental ones might be intentionally priced lower to encourage adoption, or conversely premium models are priced higher for enterprise use.\n- Hardware or infrastructure differences: running on different accelerators or regions can change effective cost.\n- Promotional, trial, or tiered pricing: you might be seeing a promotional rate on one model or a different account-level contract.\n- Usage patterns: the same interaction can cost more on a larger model because it uses more tokens or heavier inference; small differences in how you prompt can amplify cost differences.\n\nIf you want a concrete answer, I can:\n- Do a focused lookup of official pricing pages and recent changelogs (I\u2019ll search OpenAI\u2019s pricing docs, blog, and relevant release notes).\n- Help you compare raw math if you paste a sample billing line or tell me how many tokens/requests you\u2019ve been making (I can\u2019t access your billing myself).\n- Walk through how to check whether you\u2019re being billed per-token vs per-request or whether you have any enterprise/contract adjustments.\n\nYour call \u2014 I can dig into the official docs right now if you want me to. Personally, I agree with you: pricing differences that aren\u2019t explained are annoying.",
