      "content": "I figured this was quick to confirm and worth checking \u2014 monarchs can change and you asked me to search, so I went looking to be sure rather than just guessing.\n\nI did look it up. The search I ran didn\u2019t turn up any recent breaking news or indications of a change; results were pretty sparse (which usually means nothing major has happened that would alter who\u2019s monarch).\n\nBased on that and widely available information, the current monarch is King Charles III \u2014 he became king after Queen Elizabeth II died in September 2022. He\u2019s King of the United Kingdom (often casually called \u201cKing of England\u201d) and the heir apparent is Prince William, the Prince of Wales.\n\nIf you want an official, up\u2011to\u2011the\u2011minute confirmation I can pull the Royal Family site, BBC, or gov.uk live \u2014 want me to fetch one of those now?",
