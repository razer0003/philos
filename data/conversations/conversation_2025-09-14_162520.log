I found the main \u201cCharles Darwin\u201d page (and a separate result for Charles Galton Darwin), and the opening sentence on that page reads:\n\n\"Charles Robert Darwin (12 February 1809 \u2013 19 April 1882) was an English naturalist, geologist and biologist, best known for his contributions to the science of evolution.\"\n\nHeads-up: Wikipedia pages can be edited, so that exact wording might change over time, but that\u2019s what the lead line currently says on the Charles Darwin article I checked. Want me to pull the next sentence or the full lead section?",
