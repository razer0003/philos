      "content": "Okay \u2014 I went to look because you asked me to check whether Charlie Kirk has died and what the reporting consensus is. I wanted to see what news outlets and public records were saying before answering.\n\nI searched and found mixed / limited results. One result flagged that there was only limited information available (which usually means either nothing major has been widely reported yet or the search couldn't find reliable coverage). Another result I found was a page that explicitly lists Charles James Kirk (born Oct 14, 1993) with a death date of Sept 10, 2025 and a short bio. Those are the only things the search returned prominently.\n\nBottom line: there isn\u2019t a clear consensus from reputable outlets in what I found just now. A single page claiming a death without corroboration from major news organizations, Turning Point USA, or Kirk\u2019s verified social accounts is not enough to treat it as confirmed. I\u2019m skeptical until I see confirmations from major wire services (AP/Reuters), national outlets, or an official statement from his organization or family.\n\nIf you want, I can keep digging \u2014 check AP/Reuters/CNN/NYT, look at Turning Point USA\u2019s official statements, or scan social media for confirmations. Do you want me to do that?",
